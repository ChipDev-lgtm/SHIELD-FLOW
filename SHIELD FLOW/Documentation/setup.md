# Setup

## Generating the App Password
When using SHIELD FLOW, it is best to follow these steps for a smooth experience.

If you haven't already, make a google account, and [verify it with 2-Step Verification here](https://myaccount.google.com/security).

With 2 Step, [make an App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?continue=https://myaccount.google.com/security), and name it "Mail". Be sure to copy the password, because you will be using it to log in to SHIELD FLOW.
the password should look something like this" `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`

## Opening the Interface
To open SHIELD FLOW, run the following commands in your terminal in `.\SHIELD-FLOW\SHIELD FLOW\`
```bash
python server.py
python view.py
```
It should open a tkinter window. If it shows an error, try installing all the dependencies.

Now you just have to sign up with your gmail account, the generated app password, and for the other fields you can fill out with whatever you need.
**Remember, you can't change these details, so put the information carefully.**

Now you should get a verification email. [Check your email](https://mail.google.com/mail) and type the 6-digit code given. If you don't see the email, check All Mail.

You should now be redirected to the log-in page where you just put in your username and password. After that, you can now use the app.
